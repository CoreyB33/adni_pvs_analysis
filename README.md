First, ADNI stands for the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.
Second, PVS stands for perivascular spaces, a neuroimaging pathology often visible on T1-weighted brain MR imaging in older adults. This pathology is indicative of vascular damage in the brain and possibly impaired clearance of molecular debris.
This script takes PVS data derived from ADNI data using the pvs_mri_segmentation repository and merges it with other clinical data from ADNI.
The script then runs statistical models to identify associations between PVS and some of the neuropsychological outcomes assessed in ADNI.
